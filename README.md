# GuildGrabber
A program to download all messages in a Discord server

# How To Use
Download or build (requires https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA to build), then run the jarfile.
You will see a notice about a file called token.ini.
Find your Discord API token, then paste it into the file.
Lauch the jarfile with the Discord server you want to archive as the argument.
Note, special characters such as spaces need to be prefixed with "\". For example, a server called "Hello World" wos,uld need to be typed in as "Hello\ World".
If all goes well, the program will begin to archive the server!

# Safety
Discord probably doesn't want you doing this, so be careful. Also, if you use your own account, then you have a larger chance of getting banned. Use with caution.
