# GuildGrabber
A program to download all messages in a Discord server

# How To Use
Download or build, then run the jarfile in a terminal or command prompt.
You will see a notice about a file called token.ini.
Find your Discord API token, then paste it into the file.
Launch the jarfile with the Discord server you want to archive's IP as an argument.
If all goes well, the program will begin to archive the server!

# Safety
Discord probably doesn't want you doing this, so be careful. Also, if you use your own account, then you have a larger chance of getting banned. Use with caution, and don't blame me for anything that happens to your account.
